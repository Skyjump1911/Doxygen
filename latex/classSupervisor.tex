{\footnotesize\ttfamily double Supervisor\+::calculate\+Pay (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})\hspace{0.3cm}{\ttfamily [virtual]}}

this function calculates how much money the supervisor has coming for the pay period

\begin{DoxyPrecond}{Precondition}
the hours worked and hourly rate of the supervisor must already be known and entered into the supervisor class, or else the math won\textquotesingle{}t work 
\end{DoxyPrecond}

\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyPostcond}{Postcondition}
Nothing is changed about the supervisor, the only thing that we get from this function is finding out how much they are to be paid
\end{DoxyPostcond}
This is the function which calculates how much money the supervisor has earned for a pay period

\begin{DoxyPrecond}{Precondition}
the amount of hours worked and hourly rate must have already been entered correctly in order for this to work 
\end{DoxyPrecond}
